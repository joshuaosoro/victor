## Literature Review.

Teenage pregnancy, defined as pregnancy in girls between the ages of 10 - 19 years continues to be a challenge in Siaya county and even in Kenya. Over the years, there has been a raft of measures and interventions intended at reducing teenage pregnancy in Kenya by the national government, county governments and also by partners at sub-national level. One of the most notable measures was the coming to life of the National Guidelines for Provision of Adolescent and Youth Friendly Services in Kenya, 2016.

The KDHS(2014) data indicated that in Siaya county, 17.2% of teenage girls between 15 - 19 years had begun child bearing. In the subsequent report KDHS(2022) indicated that 20.9% of girls between 15 - 19 years had begun child bearing in Siaya county. This increase is in spite of the existence of the National Guidelines for Provision of Adolescent and Youth Friendly Services in Kenya, 2016. This increase thus implied that the document was not effective in curbing teenage pregnancy in Siaya county.

The increase in the proportion of teenage pregnancy could therefore be a consequence of other factors not addressed by the National Guidelines for Provision of Adolescent and Youth Friendly Services in Kenya, 2016. @ochieng2022 in a study investigating the availability and readiness of Health facilities to deliver Sexual and Reproductive Health for young people found that only about a quarter (26%) of the total personnel surveyed were trained on youth-friendly services, obviously a very low proportion. It was also found that almost half (47.83%) of the health facilities surveyed had no plan of conducting outreach for young people.

Regarding teenagers' knowledge on comprehensive sexual and reproductive health information services amongst teenagers, KDHS(2014) reported that 100% of currently married women and men aged between 15 - 49 years old have at least heard about a contraceptive method. This statistic does not however capture the unmarried teenagers and the teenagers below the age of 15 years but the finding is supported by @Tshombe et al. (2020) which found that majority of the teenagers received information on ASRH in their schools thus implying that teenagers are aware of sexual and reproductive health information.
