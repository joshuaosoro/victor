## Literature Review.

Teenage pregnancy, defined as pregnancy in girls between the ages of 10 - 19 years continues to be a challenge in Siaya county and even in Kenya. Over the years, there has been a raft of measures and interventions intended at reducing teenage pregnancy in Kenya by the national government, county governments and also by partners at sub-national level.

One of the most notable measures was the coming to life of the National Guidelines for Provision of Adolescent and Youth Friendly Services in Kenya, 2016. This was an attempt at addressing the issue teenage pregnancy by aligning adolescent health service provision in Kenya to international standards as this would effectively improve service provision to the adolescents. For example, @World2019 outlines key characteristics of adolescent-friendly health services as being Equitable; Accessible; Acceptable; Appropriate and Effective.

On the first objective of the National Guidelines for Provision of Adolescent and Youth Friendly Services in Kenya, 2016 - defining the essential package of health services to be provided to adolescents and youth at service delivery points; @ochieng2022 investigating availability and readiness of health facilities to deliver sexual and reproductive health services for young people in Western Kenya, including Siaya county, it was established that only a quarter (26%) of the total personnel surveyed were trained on youth-friendly services; up to 17% of the health facilities did not provide information on SRHR services. The same report also found that almost half (47.83%) of the health facilities surveyed had no plan of conducting outreach for young people, which is an important ingredient in getting services to the most vulnerable adolescents according to @denno2015

The other objectives of the National Guidelines for Provision of Adolescent and Youth Friendly Services in Kenya, 2016 - increasing access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health information and services among adolescents and youth appears to have been achieved; @Tshombe2020 in a study done in Bondo sub-county found that majority of teenagers have received information on ASRH in their schools thus implying that teenagers are aware of sexual and reproductive health information. This finding does not however necessarily apply to the entire Siaya county.

Despite these efforts, KDHS(2022) indicated that 20.9% of girls between 15 - 19 years had begun child bearing in Siaya county. This is an increase from a figure of 17.2% that was reported in KDHS(2014). This increase thus implied that the National Guidelines for Provision of Adolescent and Youth Friendly Services in Kenya, 2016 was not effective in curbing teenage pregnancy in Siaya county. The increase in the proportion of teenage pregnancy could therefore be a sign that the National Guidelines for Provision of Adolescent and Youth Friendly Services in Kenya, 2016 was for some reason not effective in curbing teenage pregnancy.
