      <title>Background</title>
      <para>
        Teenage pregnancy is a subject of interest not only because of
        the social implications it has for the young people who make up
        a significant proportion of the population but also because of
        the medical implications it has as elucidated in studies like
        Boia et al. (2016). The MOH came up with the 2016 National
        Guideline for the provision of AYFS in a bid to improve SRH
        health services especially among the youth. Considering the
        importance of teenage pregnancy, it is imperative to evaluate
        the progress that has been made so far since this document came
        into place. It is worth noting that there has not been research
        into the impact that the 2016 National Guideline for provision
        of AYFS has had on teenage pregnancy in Siaya county and even at
        the National level.
      </para>
      <para>
        Currently, one of the ways of ascertaining the influence of the
        2016 National Guideline for provision of AYFS has had on teenage
        pregnancy in Siaya county is by relying on the data provided
        periodically by the KDHS on childbearing by girls between the
        age of 15 - 19 years old. It should however be noted that this
        age bracket ignores a significant portion of the population of
        girls below the age of 15 years old who are also vulnerable and
        have reported a lot of pregnancy cases. Because of this
        unaccounted segment of the population, it is not sufficient to
        rely on the KDHS data which only accounts for pregnancies for
        teenagers between the age of 15 - 19 years. Additionally, it is
        important to discern the impact that this document has had in
        Siaya county given that Siaya county has its own unique
        challenges.
      </para>
      <para>
        This study investigates the influence of the 2016 National
        Guideline for the Provision of AYFS in reducing teenage
        pregnancy in Siaya county among those between the age of 13 - 19
        years by conducting qualitative studies targeting a sample of
        key stakeholders like medics, parents and also girls between the
        ages of 13 - 19 years old. The results from this study will give
        a clearer picture to the stakeholders regarding the influence
        this document has had in regards to teenage pregnancy; the
        information that teenagers have about comprehensive sexual and
        reproductive health and consequently put forward measures to
        address the gaps that exist to address teenage pregnancy in
        Siaya county. Also, this study will inform targeted intervention
        programs to reduce teenage pregnancies in Siaya county.

      <title>Justification for the study.</title>
      <para>
        KDHS(2022) has shown that, in Siaya county, 20.9% of the girls
        aged between 15 - 19 years old had begun child bearing. This
        figure is higher than 17.2% which was reported by KDHS(2014)
        thus raising fears over the effectiveness of the National
        Guidelines for Provision of Adolescent Youth-Friendly Guidelines
        (2016) in containing teenage pregnancies.
      </para>
      <para>
        This study therefore aims to establish the effectiveness of this
        guideline with respect to teenage pregnancy; assess knowledge of
        teenagers on comprehensive SRH information and suggest measures
        to address gaps in order to reduce teenage pregnancies which
        seems to be on an upward trend in Siaya county.

    <title>Literature Review.</title>
    <para>
      Teenage pregnancy, defined as pregnancy in girls between the ages
      of 13 - 19 years continues to be a challenge in Siaya county and
      even in Kenya. Over the years, there has been a raft of measures
      and interventions intended at reducing teenage pregnancy in Kenya
      by the MOH, county governments and also by partners both at
      national and sub-national level.One of the most notable measures
      was the coming to life of the National Guidelines for Provision of
      AYFS in Kenya, 2016. This was an attempt at addressing among other
      reproductive issues, the issue of teenage pregnancy by aligning
      AYSRH provision in Kenya to international standards.
    </para>
    <para>
      One of the objectives of the National Guidelines for Provision of
      Adolescent and Youth Friendly Services in Kenya, 2016 was to
      standardize the provision of quality AYSRH Services at all levels
      by ensuring reproductive health service provision for adolescents
      and youth are equitable; accessible; acceptable; appropriate and
      effective as outlined in WHO et al. (2019). This would then, among
      other things, translate to a reduction in teenage pregnancies. A
      study in Western Kenya by Wafula et al. (2022) investigating the
      availability and readiness of health facilities to deliver sexual
      and reproductive health services for young people found that only
      a small proportion of healthcare personnel providing AYSRH to
      young people have actually received training on the same. This
      lack of training for healthcare personnel on AYSRH makes the
      Guideline less likely to achieve its objectives because of lack of
      skills by the service providers to handle young people
      appropriately. Having conducted the study in the larger Western
      Kenya, the results by Wafula et al. (2022) may not mirror the true
      picture in Siaya county because healthcare is a devolved function
      and thus disparities do exist across the counties. Furthermore,
      the study did not investigate the impact that lack of training on
      provision of AYSRH among healthcare providers had specifically
      when it comes to teenage pregnancy. This gap thus necessitates an
      evaluation in Siaya county independent of the other counties.
    </para>
    <para>
      The second objective of the National Guidelines for Provision of
      AYFS in Kenya, 2016 - defining the essential package of health
      services to be provided to adolescents and youth at service
      delivery points; Ochieng’ et al. (2022), while investigating
      availability and readiness of health facilities to deliver AYSRH
      for young people in Western Kenya, including Siaya county,
      established that only a quarter (26%) of the total personnel
      surveyed were trained on youth-friendly services; up to 17% of the
      health facilities did not provide information on SRH services and
      this means that young people are not aware of the available
      services. The same report also found that almost half (47.83%) of
      the health facilities surveyed had no plan of conducting outreach
      for young people, which is an important ingredient in getting
      services to the most vulnerable teenagers according to Denno,
      Hoopes, and Chandra-Mouli (2015). There is therefore potentially a
      huge possibility that a significant proportion of youth remain
      unaware of the available SRH health services available at service
      delivery points because of these gaps. Additionally, the result of
      this investigation was a generalization of the larger Western
      Kenya and not Siaya county specifically, consequently, it is not
      possible to get a clear picture of the influence that the National
      Guideline for provision of adolescent and youth friendly services,
      2016 has had in Siaya county from this investigation.
    </para>
    <para>
      The other key objective of the National Guidelines for Provision
      of Adolescent and Youth Friendly Services in Kenya, 2016 -
      increasing access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health
      information and services among adolescents and youth, appears to
      have been achieved; Tshombe et al. (2020) while investigating
      Utilization of adolescent reproductive health services in Bondo
      sub-county, Siaya county found that majority of teenagers have
      received information on Reproductive health in their schools thus
      implying that teenagers have received sexual and reproductive
      health information. The same report also indicated that young
      people in form one and two are relatively less informed by their
      counterparts in form three and four. The finding of this study
      does not however necessarily apply to the entire Siaya county as
      it was only limited to Bondo sub-county thus necessitating an
      investigation covering the entire Siaya county.
    </para>
    <para>
      Despite the positive progress reported by various studies, the
      KDHS(2014) and KDHS(2022) indicated that 17.2% and 20.9% of girls
      between 15 - 19 years respectively had begun child bearing in
      Siaya county. This upward trend casts doubts on the effectiveness
      of the 2016 National Guidelines for Provision of AYFS in Kenya in
      reducing teenage pregnancies in Siaya county. However, it should
      be noted that this statistic did not include the entire age
      bracket that defines teenagers, 13 - 19 years old. As such, it
      cannot be concluded whether or not the 2016 National Guidelines
      for Provision of AYFS in Kenya was effective in reducing teenage
      pregnancies with regard to Siaya county.
